## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

>>> When working on this project some of the issues were integrating complex functionality 
like filtering games based on their funding status, debugging issues such as incorrect data 
being displayed and ensuring that the DOM updates correctly with each filter required 
careful attention, and managing multiple functions and ensuring smooth interaction 
between the various event listeners making sure nothing overlaps.
